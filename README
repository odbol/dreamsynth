ascension of the builders
==========
by odbol

Their city consumed by flames of a dying star, The Builders looked back in reminiscent grace, their memories decaying. As the solar conflagration returned their blood to the dust beneath the streets, a curious force swept through their physical bodies, separating flesh and consciousness from their souls.

Reborn as spheres of plasma energy, those who built the ancient city from sinew and steel begin to ascend. The mechatropolis receding quickly below them, their memories erased, The Ascended begin on their forever upward path toward new understandings of the oldest knowledge.
